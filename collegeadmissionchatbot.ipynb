Welcome to College Admission Assistance Chatbot!
Ask me anything related to college admissions or say 'exit' to end the conversation.
You: Hello!
Bot: Hi! How can I assist you today?
You: Can you provide information about admission requirements?
Bot: Are you looking for information about admission requirements? I can help you with 
college admissions.
You: Yes, I'm interested in knowing the admission requirements for Computer Science.
Bot: Which college are you interested in? Tell me more about the college you have in 
mind.
You: I'm considering applying to ABC University for Computer Science.
Bot: Great choice! Here are the general admission requirements for ABC University's 
Computer Science program:
- Minimum GPA of 3.0
- SAT score of 1300 or higher
- Strong background in mathematics and science subjects
- Demonstrated interest or experience in computer science through extracurricular 
activities or projects
You: Thank you for the information!
Bot: You're welcome!
You: What are the chances of getting admitted with a GPA of 3.5 and an SAT score of 1400?
Bot: Based on the information provided, you are likely to get admitted to college.
You: That's good to hear! Can you help me with some general college application tips?
Bot: Sure! Here are some general tips for college applications:
1. Start early and stay organized.
2. Highlight your strengths and unique qualities in your application essays.
3. Get involved in extracurricular activities that align with your interests.
4. Request recommendation letters from teachers who know you well.
5. Double-check all application materials for accuracy before submission.
You: I'm interested in engineering programs, but I'm not sure which colleges have strong 
programs and would be a good fit for me.
Chatbot: That's great! Engineering programs can be very rewarding. To help suggest 
colleges, I can consider a few factors:
Your academic record: What's your GPA and how did you perform in math and science 
courses?
Standardized test scores: Are you planning to take the SAT or ACT?
Specific engineering interests: Do you have a particular branch of engineering in mind 
(e.g., electrical, mechanical, biomedical)?
Desired college size and location: Are you looking for a large research university or a 
smaller, more personal learning environment?
You: Thanks for the advice!
Bot: No problem!
You: Exit
Goodbye!
